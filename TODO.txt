Day 1:

  Linux Slides
    - Slides 29 and 32: replace {} with <> as the placeholder
    - Slide 19 replace Windows entry with the appropriate entry for WSL

  Setup:
    - Add instructions for how to setup the code command for VSCode on macOS and for WSL.
    - Make the zip file, figure out where to put it, and update the instructions for picking it up.

  Question: should we move the description of the work for the Linux practice session from the README into
    the CAPP Camp setup documentation or should we just include a PDF?

Day 2:
  Setup:
    - Create the classroom and update URL below

  Question: do we want to one or more pushes to this lab and, possibly,
  have them look at the repo on Github before and after the push?


Day 3:
   Setup:
     - we need instructions for installing uv on WSL
     - add instructions for uv on WSL
     - add the correct output for the Python version check
     - I (AMR) used 3.13 for the Python version.  We'll need to update that
        if Suhail wants to use something different.
     - Fix the place where it shows the output from the version check
   Slides:
     - Fill in the placeholder slides.
     - Switch to using <> for placeholders or maybe switch the <> placeholders elsewhere to {}.
     - See the speaker notes in each slide for other possible changes.

   Lab:
     - Remove AMR's changes
     - Update the autograder.  I'd like to have four tests:
        (1) that tests "air" on game.py,
	(2) one that tests "aiiiiir" on game.py
	(3) one that tests "aiiiiir" on game_repeats.py
	(4) one that tests "boo" on game_repeats.py

       I would have made this change, but I am not familar with the testing framework
       you used and I ran out of time/energy to figure out how to fix it.
