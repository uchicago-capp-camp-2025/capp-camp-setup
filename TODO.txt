Day 1:

  Linux Slides
    - Slide 19 replace Windows entry with the appropriate entry for WSL
    - Slide 35 slide talks about -r, but then has an example with -f.  Not easily fixable.
    - Slide 54: Add URL for setup document

  Setup:
    - Take a screenshot of a WSL terminal.
    - Add instructions for how to setup the code command for VSCode for WSL.  Does it come automatically installed?
    - Zip file currently is in http://cs.uchicago.edu/~amr/capp-camp-files.zip.  Is there a better place to put it?
    - add instructions for uv on WSL
    - add Python version check output


  Question: some of our instructions use Ctrl-X and some use Ctrl + X.  Are we OK with using two different styles or
   do we want to pick one and stick to it?  If so, which one?  USE BOTH


Day 2:
  Slides:
    Slide 14 -- maybe we should move this file to follow slide 38 and then again
    after slide 42?

  Setup:

  Lab:
    - the history in the template repository is not showing up when I accept the assignment
      using my student alter ego.  What did I do wrong in the setup process?
    - the slides have them do a push write away.  I added two pushes into the README itself.  Should
      we skip the slides? Should I update the README text for the pushes?

  Question: the xcode install process takes a while (20 minutes or so).
  Should we have the students do the Day 2 installation process at the
  end of Day 1?  That will allow us to have a predictable start time
  for Day 2.

Day 3:
   Slides:
     - See the speaker notes in each slide for other possible changes.

   Lab:
     - JPT added autograder with these four tests, glad to make changes
        (1) that tests "air" on game.py,
	(2) one that tests "aiiiiir" on game.py
	(3) one that tests "aiiiiir" on game_repeats.py
	(4) one that tests "boo" on game_repeats.py
     - AMR: removed the last test, since it works for the first submission.
