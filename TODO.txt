-- check the SLIDE URLs and schedule a message for Ed

-- Ed post:

 (1) How to forget a network
 (2) Link setup documents
 (3) A link to the slide PDF








Day 1:

  Linux Slides
    - Slide 54: Add URL for setup document

  Setup:
    - Zip file currently is in http://cs.uchicago.edu/~amr/capp-camp-files.zip.  Is there a better place to put it?

Day 2:
  Slides:
    Slide 14 -- maybe we should move this file to follow slide 38 and then again
    after slide 42?

Day 3:
   Slides:
     - See the speaker notes in each slide for other possible changes.

   Lab:
     - JPT added autograder with these four tests, glad to make changes
        (1) that tests "air" on game.py,
	(2) one that tests "aiiiiir" on game.py
	(3) one that tests "aiiiiir" on game_repeats.py
	(4) one that tests "boo" on game_repeats.py
     - AMR: removed the last test, since it works for the first submission.
