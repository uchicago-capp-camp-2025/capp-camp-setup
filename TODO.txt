Day 1:

  Linux Slides
    - Slide 19 replace Windows entry with the appropriate entry for WSL
    - Add URL for setup document to slide 3

  Setup:
    - Take a screenshot of a WSL terminal.
    - Add instructions for how to setup the code command for VSCode for WSL.  Does it come automatically installed?
    - Make the zip file, figure out where to put it, and update the instructions for picking it up.

Day 2:
  Slides:
    Slide 14 -- maybe we should move this file to follow slide 38 and then again
    after slide 42?

  Setup:

  Lab:
    - the history in the template repository is not showing up when I accept the assignment
      using my student alter ego.  What did I do wrong in the setup process?

  Question: the xcode install process takes a while (20 minutes or so).
  Should we have the students do the Day 2 installation process at the
  end of Day 1?  That will allow us to have a predictable start time
  for Day 2.

Day 3:
   Setup:
     - we need instructions for installing uv on WSL
     - add instructions for uv on WSL
     - add the correct output for the Python version check (confirmed w/ Suhail 3.13 will be used)
     - Fix the place where it shows the output from the version check

   Slides:
     - See the speaker notes in each slide for other possible changes.

   Lab:
     - JPT added autograder with these four tests, glad to make changes
        (1) that tests "air" on game.py,
	(2) one that tests "aiiiiir" on game.py
	(3) one that tests "aiiiiir" on game_repeats.py
	(4) one that tests "boo" on game_repeats.py
     - AMR: removed the last test, since it works for the first submission.
