# CAPP Camp Filesystem Lab

For this lab, you will be practicing manipulating files on the filesystem using the terminal.

This file uses Markdown syntax.  You can mostly ignore the markdown
with one exception.  Tick marks around text indicate code formatting
for that text.  So, for example, when you are asked to create a
directory named `animals` using the `mkdir` command, the tick marks
should not be included for either the command name or the directory
name.

Alternatively, if you open this file in VS Code, you can view a
formatted version of the file using the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl-k v`
on WSL or `Cmd-k v` on macOS.

In this directory you'll find:

- `README.md` - this file
- `check.py` - a python script that checks if your directory structure looks as expected
- `files/` - a directory with a bunch of text files all mixed up together

At any point you may type `uv run python check.py` **within this directory** and you will see a description of your progress.

### Tips

- Do not rush through to the "brute force" solution, consider what keyboard shortcuts, globs, etc. will be helpful. The goal is to gain familiarity with the terminal.
- Run `uv run python check.py` after each part to ensure that you didn't miss anything.

## Part 0: Explore `files/`

Take a look at the `files/` directory provided. Use `ls`, `cd`, and `cat` to examine the files.

You should discover that there are files about animals, planets, and comets all mixed up.

Our goal today is to reorganize these files.

## Part 1: Making Directories

We'll want to create a few directories:

- `animals/` - to contain all files on animals
- `space/` - which will have two subdirectories
  - `space/planets`
  - `space/comets`

Use the `mkdir` command to create all of these directories.

Run `uv run python check.py` (from the `filesystem-lab` directory) when ready.

## Part 2: Moving Files

Next, you will need to move files into place, `check.py` will check
which files are in the right place.

Note: One of the files is misnamed.  Figure out which file is misnamed
and name it properly when you move it.

Tip: if in doubt based on a file name, use `cat` to view the contents.

Run `uv run python check.py` (from the `filesystem-lab` directory) when ready.

### Part 3: Editing Files

Each file in `planets/` contains a line "moons: N" (where N is a number of moons).

You'll need to make the following changes:

- Jupiter had three new moons confirmed in 2023, so update Jupiter to have 95 moons instead of 92.
- There is no `venus.txt`. Venus has no moons. Add a new file for Venus, with "moons: 0".

Once you are done with those changes, `uv run python check.py` will confirm you are done with this lab!
