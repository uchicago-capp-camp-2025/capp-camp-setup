Creating a practice repository
==============================

Many of your CS classes will use GitHub Classroom, which is a tool
that makes it easy for instructors to create repositories for their
students and distribute to starter code.

We'll be using GitHub classroom to create the repository that
you will be using for this afternoon's practice session.

To create your repository, click on the following URL `https://classroom.github.com/a/Vwiv_5G1 <https://classroom.github.com/a/Vwiv_5G1>`__ and then select
your UChicago email address from the list. Finally, authorize GitHub
to connect your account to our GitHub classroom.

Please ask for help if you run into any problems.

You are finished with the setup for Day 2 once you have authorized
GitHub classroom to connect to your GitHub account.  Please do not do
anything else with this repository at this time.
