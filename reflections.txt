Install --

- Have folks who have finished their installations move into the common area to keep the noise level down.

Linux --

- slides are not quite in the right order.  At a minimum, the setup slide that
has the change to the capp-camp-files directory needs to come later.

Git --

- Add slides about `git restore` to the local repo discussion
- Put together better slides about remotes
- Lab -
  * have the students restore one of the (uncommited) changed files
  * have the students stage one of the changed files and then restore it.

Labs --
  - move the instructions from the README file to an HTML file.  That will allow us to
    include the instructions that are currently on slides/in Ed messages into the
    lab instructions.  Having it all in one place seems better.
