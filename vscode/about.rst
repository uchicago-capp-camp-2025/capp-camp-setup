Visual Studio Code
==================

Your `code editor
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-code_editor>`__ will be an
indispensable tool will for the CS classes that are part of the CAPP
core.  While you are welcome to use whatever code editor works best
for you, `Visual Studio Code <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`__ (or
"VS Code") is a popular option because it both fairly beginner-friendly
and a very powerful tool once you familiarize itself with all
its bells and whistles.

Most notably, it is well suited for a variety of programming languages,
which means that, if you become fluent in using VS Code with Python,
and then need to edit some C or Javascript code, you won't have to learn
how to use a new editor from scratch.

Additionally, VS Code makes it fairly easy to connect to a remote
server via SSH, which means you can use VS Code on your personal
computer to edit files that live in the CAPP servers, as well as
interact with those files (e.g., to run your code) from a built-in
terminal.

Finally, VS Code is free! You won't have to pay anything to use it.

In this section, we provide instructions on how to:

- :ref:`Install VS Code <vscode-install>`,
- :ref:`Set up VS Code to connect to the CAPP Linux servers with SSH <vscode-ssh>`, and
- :ref:`Set up a few common configuration options <vscode-config>`.
