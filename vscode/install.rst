Windows

Click this button to download. Once it is downloaded, run the installer (``VSCodeUserSetup-<version>.exe``).

After you accept the license agreement, click *Next >*. On the page titled *Select Additional Tasks*, we recommend you check all the boxes (but it is up to you).

Go to https://code.visualstudio.com/. You should see a blue button labeled *Download for Mac Universal, Stable Build*.

Click on this button to download. When the download is complete, you will have a new application file called *Visual Studio Code*. You might instead have zip file, with a name like ``VSCode-darwin-universal.zip``; in this case, open the file to unzip it, and the *Visual Studio Code* application file should appear. Open a *Finder* window and navigate to *Downloads* (it will likely be listed under "Favorites" in the left sidebar). Locate the file named *Visual Studio Code*, and drag it on top of *Applications* in the left side bar.

Now, you can find VSCode in your Applications folder, and can open it with a click.


Linux
~~~~~

Go to https://code.visualstudio.com/. You should see two blue buttons labeled *.deb* and *.rpm*. Since most of you will be using Ubuntu, click on the *.deb* button.
